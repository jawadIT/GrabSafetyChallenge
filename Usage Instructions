1. GrabSafetyDataPreparation.ipynb :

          set pyspark environment based on the paths of your machine 
          set paths to read data from 
          
          This module will give a .csv file with one observation for each trip

2. GrabSafetyModelBuilding.ipynb :

          set pyspark environment based on the paths of your machine 
          set paths to read data from 
         
          This module will read the output of above program and build classification algorithms 
          
          *logistic binomial , decision tree , random forest and gradient boost algorithm
          
          Accuracy stands ar 77% , but there is a lot to improve in recall value [classyfing non-safe to safe trip]
          
3. Models.zip : 

          This will have the pickle file for each of the above four models
          
          Copy them to the path from where you can call load these models 
          
4. API    : 

          Flask + Swagger based API to load a trip file and get the result if drive is safe or not-safe
          
          trigger API by hitting "http://localhost:5000/apidocs" from your local machine
          
          
Result will be find in column Prediction column , along with the confidense level by probability value
